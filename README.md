# Nand2Tetris

![image](first.png)


[The Nand to Tetris course](http://nand2tetris.org/) takes you on a self-paced fascinating voyage of discovery in which you will go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a Central Processing Unit, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a general-purpose computer that can run any program that you fancy. In the process of building this computer you will become familiar with many important hardware abstractions, and you will implement them, hands on. But most of all, you will enjoy the tremendous thrill of building a complex and useful system from the ground up.

The course homework consists of a series 6 projects:

* Project 1: Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more
* Project 2: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
* Project 3: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)
* Project 4: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs
* Project 5: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4
* Project 6: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.

**What youâ€™ll need**:
This is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.

**You will build the hardware projects on your home computer**, using a simple Hardware Description Language (HDL), learned in the course, and a hardware simulator, supplied by us. A hardware simulator is a software system that enables building and simulating logic gates and chips before actually committing them to silicon. This is exactly what hardware engineers do in practice: they build and test computers in simulation, using HDL and hardware simulators.


The Course Instructors are [Noam Nisan](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~noam/) and [Shimon Schocken](http://shimonschocken.com/).
